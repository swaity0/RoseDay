          for U.
          <br />
          I'm so lucky to have found someone like u. U've become everything in my life, the reason for my happiness, and everything good in my life. Every day u make me love u more and more. I love ur soul, ur looks, ur personality, ur behavior, ur style, ur thinking, and everything else about u. U've made me discover myself with u, made me love myself, love life, and love having u in my life. U're the only good thing in it, giving my life meaning. I want to spend the rest of my life with u, doing everything with u, even the tough times. I want to spend them with u, knowing that all u'll do is make me happy. Just having u around is enough to make me happy. All I want is to make u happy as much as I can. Thank u for being in my life, and thank u for becoming my life. I love u ðŸ’—          <br />
