          <span>My Love,</span>
          for U.
          <br />
          I love u, Zahra. It's only u. The reason I love u is infinite, and I can't describe it in a simple message like this. Every day, my love for u grows more and more. I love u more and more and I want u more and more. The more time I spend with u, the more everything increases for u. Every time I breathe, u come to my mind. Every time I move, u come to my mind. Every time my heart beats, u come to my mind. Even in my sleep, I dream of u. I want to hug u, hear ur voice, listen to ur words, kiss u, and do everything with u. I want u, only u, my love, my wife, my friend, my life, and my everything. I love u with an unnatural love, and I promise to give u everything u deserve and more, to make u happy in ur whole life, in our marriage, and in our relationship. I promise I will never hurt u or ruin ur life and will always make u happy. It's u and only u, and I won't stop loving u until the end of my life. In hell and in heaven, u will remain in my mind. I love u so much and I want u to be mine and only mine, my love. If I talk about my love for u, I won't finish in a whole year. U are perfect. Ur appearance is perfect. Ur personality is perfect. Ur laugh is perfect. Ur voice is perfect. Ur words are perfect. Ur body is perfect. Ur face is perfect. Ur style is perfect. Everything about u is perfect. From the moment I saw u, I loved u, the best woman in the world, my princess.          <br />
